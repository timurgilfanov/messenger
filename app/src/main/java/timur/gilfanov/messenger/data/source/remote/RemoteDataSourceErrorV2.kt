/**
 * Common errors for remote data source operations.
 *
 * Focused on network and server-level failures during remote API calls.
 * Entity-specific errors (e.g., UserNotFound) are defined in separate
 * interfaces (e.g., RemoteUserDataSourceError) and compose this interface
 * for common infrastructure errors.
 *
 * ## Migration from RemoteDataSourceError
 *
 * This interface replaces [RemoteDataSourceError] with better separation of concerns:
 *
 * ### Errors moved to entity-specific interfaces:
 * - ChatNotFound, MessageNotFound → RemoteChatDataSourceError, RemoteMessageDataSourceError
 *
 * ### Errors moved to operation-specific interfaces:
 * - InvalidInviteLink, ExpiredInviteLink → Join chat operation errors
 * - ChatClosed, AlreadyJoined, ChatFull → Join chat operation errors
 * - UserBlocked → Operation-specific error types
 *
 * ### Errors moved to auth-specific interface:
 * - Unauthorized → RemoteAuthDataSourceError or similar
 *
 * ### Errors kept in V2 (infrastructure errors):
 * - NetworkNotAvailable, ServerUnreachable → ServiceUnavailable hierarchy
 * - ServerError → ServerError
 * - RateLimitExceeded → RateLimitExceeded
 * - CooldownActive → CooldownActive
 * - UnknownError → UnknownServiceError
