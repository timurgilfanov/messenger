 * Common error taxonomy for user repository operations involving remote data.

 * - [Unauthenticated] - Caller is not authenticated or session expired
 *
 * ## Authorization Errors (What can you do?)
 * - [InsufficientPermissions] - Caller lacks permission for the operation
 *
 * ## Operation Outcome Errors
 * - [Failed] - Operation definitely failed with a known error
 * - [UnknownStatus] - Operation outcome is unknown
