 * Upload state for file operations.

 * ```kotlin
 * when (uploadState) {
 *     FileUploadState.Idle -> hideProgressIndicator()
 *     is FileUploadState.Uploading -> showProgress(uploadState.percent)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see ProfileEditUiState.pictureUploadState for usage in profile picture uploads
