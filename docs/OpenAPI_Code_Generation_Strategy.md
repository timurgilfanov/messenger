# Long-Term OpenAPI + Code Generation Strategy Analysis

Based on research conducted in August 2025, here's a comprehensive analysis of using OpenAPI specification and code generation for the messenger application.

## Current State

### OpenAPI 3.1 Real-Time Support

- ❌ **No native WebSocket support** - WebSocket schemes (ws://, wss://) supported but not protocol specification
- ❌ **No native SSE support** - Ongoing discussions for SSE in OpenAPI 3.2 but not yet available
- ✅ **REST API support** - Excellent for traditional CRUD operations (chat management, user management)

### AsyncAPI Alternative

- ✅ **WebSocket support** - Designed specifically for event-driven APIs
- ❌ **Limited code generation** - WebSocket templates don't exist yet (only Kafka, AMQP, MQTT)
- ✅ **Documentation** - Great for documenting real-time API contracts
- ✅ **Kotlin DSL available** - AsyncAPI Kotlin project provides typesafe specification building

### Kotlin Code Generation Status

- ✅ **kotlinx.serialization support** - Available in OpenAPI Generator but with quality issues
- ⚠️ **Generated code quality** - Often "quite bad" and "practically unusable" for complex cases
- ✅ **Model generation** - Works well for DTOs, but manual client implementation often needed
- ❌ **KMP limitations** - kotlinx.serialization support for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile still has gaps

## Recommended Architecture (Hybrid Approach)

### Phase 1: Current Implementation (Immediate)

✅ **Keep current manual implementation** with sealed classes for type safety  
✅ **Maintain full control** and optimal code quality  
✅ **Continue with existing approach** - it's actually superior to generated code currently

### Phase 2: Selective Code Generation (6-12 months)

Use OpenAPI + code generation for **REST endpoints only**:
- User authentication
- Chat CRUD operations  
- Message history retrieval
- File uploads/downloads
- User profile management

Keep **manual implementation for real-time features**:
- WebSocket messaging
- Server-Sent Events notifications
- Typing indicators
- Presence updates
- Live message synchronization

### Phase 3: Full Integration (12-18+ months)

- Monitor AsyncAPI WebSocket code generation maturity
- Evaluate OpenAPI 3.2 SSE support when available
- Consider custom code generation templates if needed
- Assess quality improvements in OpenAPI Kotlin generators

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Best of Both Worlds**: Code generation where it works well, manual control where needed
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Doesn't break existing working code
3. **Evolutionary**: Can migrate incrementally as tooling improves
4. **Type Safety**: Maintains current sealed class benefits for errors
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to adopt new standards as they mature
6. **Quality Control**: Avoids low-quality generated code for critical paths

## Immediate Action Plan

### Documentation Phase
1. **Document current REST APIs** using OpenAPI 3.1 for documentation value
2. **Create AsyncAPI specifications** for WebSocket/SSE APIs (documentation + contract)
3. **Maintain API contracts** in version control alongside code

### Current Implementation
3. **Keep current implementation** - sealed classes provide superior type safety
4. **Continue manual approach** for real-time features where code generation falls short
5. **Focus on code quality** rather than automation for now

### Annual Evaluation
6. **Monitor OpenAPI evolution** for SSE support in 3.2+
7. **Track AsyncAPI code generation** for WebSocket template availability
8. **Evaluate Kotlin generator quality** improvements

## Technical Considerations

### Current Sealed Class Approach Advantages
- **Compile-time safety** - Exhaustive when expressions
- **Data carrying capability** - CooldownActive with duration
- **Unknown error handling** - Graceful fallback
- **IDE support** - Full autocomplete and refactoring
- **Custom logic** - Complex error mapping from details maps

### Code Generation Limitations (2024-2025)
- **Quality issues** - Generated code often requires manual fixes
- **Limited customization** - Hard to maintain existing patterns
- **Breaking changes** - Generator updates can break builds
- **Complex scenarios** - Sealed classes with data not well supported
- **Real-time gaps** - No WebSocket/SSE generation available

## Conclusion

**The current manual approach with sealed classes is actually superior to generated code for now**, providing better type safety, code quality, and maintainability than current generation tools offer.

**Recommendation**: Maintain the current high-quality manual implementation while monitoring the evolution of OpenAPI and AsyncAPI tooling. Adopt code generation selectively when it reaches the quality bar of the current implementation.
